# PWM-Fan-Controller-Disk-Shelf
Pwm fan controller and power adapter board for DIY Disk shelf using HP DL380P G8 LFF cage and backplane.
I built this board to accept two PCI-E power connections for input. Outputs are 2 PCI-E connectors to power the backplane itself and 6 pwm fans. The pwm signal is generated by a 555 circut.
